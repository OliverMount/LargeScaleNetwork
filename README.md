# Neural Signal Propagation
 

This post contains large scale neural network (not artificial) simulation (synthetic) using

<ol>
  <li> Firing rate model  </li>
  <li> Spiking rate model  </li>
  </ol>
  
All the simulations are carried out via Brian2 python module ( https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/ ). 
The anotomical connectivity of the *Macaque*, incorporated in our simulations, is obtained from http://core-nets.org/index.php (Database section).

The anatomical connectivity is defined in terms of *Fraction of Labelled Neurons* as


We aim to replicate the finding in Balanced Amplification: A New Mechanism of Selective Amplification of Neural Activity Patterns (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309001287) that uses the Brian2 module.
